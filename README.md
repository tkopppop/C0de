1: debut year: I made my debut as a celebrity in both South Korea and Japan in 1999.<br>
2: Korean TV Appearance:<br>
One Korean TV show featured a recording of my voice (a .wav file) where I sang a Korean ballad.<br>
Later, a well-known Korean singer, Cho Kyu-man, performed the same song using my voice as the base for his version.<br>
He sang the song following the sounds and tones from my audio recording.<br>
I used the same name as my real name for the debut, which helped with search keywords.<br>
3: Japanese TV Appearance:<br>
In Japan, my phone messages were featured on a show through Toda Erika, a Japanese actress and singer who helped introduce me via her entertainment manager.<br>
- Chinese Media Feature:<br>
My debut was also shown in a Chinese hacker-themed magazine, although that publication is now lost.<br>
4: Debut Style:<br>
I debuted through three creative formats—TV broadcast, music, and print media—like a producer and a creator-style artist.<br>
